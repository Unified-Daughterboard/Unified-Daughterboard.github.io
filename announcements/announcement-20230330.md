# 2023-03-30 - S1.1 and C4.1 Release

## Overview

As an incremental upgrade to the S1 and C4 series launched a few months ago, the S1.1 and C4.1 revisions have been released.  
Changes are minor - they are designed as drop-in upgrades to existing boards where S1 and C4 are used, and are backwards-compatible.  
Huge credits to Gondolindrim for calculating and implementing the updated USB routing (more on this below).  

## C4.1 Changes
- The footprint for the Molex Pico-EZmate connector has been swapped to the one used on the S1, improving the physical reinforcement on the connector while also mitigating potential issues with solder being "vacuumed out" of the pad through vias during assembly.  
- Routing has been updated to be in line with USB high-speed standards, offering improved signal reliability under high speed communications.  

## S1.1 Changes
- Routing has been updated to be in line with USB high-speed tier standards, offering improved signal reliability under high speed communications.  

## Release Data
The data for each daughterboard has been reflected in the GitHub repositories and project pages on this site.
