# Roadmap

## Future Plans 
* C4.1 release
  * Successor to C4
  * Replaces C4's Pico-EZmate footprint with a reinforced variant from S1
  * Tweaked signal routing for USB 2.0 high-speed (480mbps) compatibility
* S1.1 release
  * Successor to S1
  * Tweaked signal routing for USB 2.0 high-speed (480mbps) compatibility

## 2023/01/18 - uDB S1 Release
* Announcement post - [2022-01-18: S1 and C4 Release](announcements/announcement-20230118.md)
* New form factor
  * Narrow and wide shape which fits with less conflict on custom keyboards
  * Larger corner radii for easier case manufacturing
  * Two M3 screws which reduce logistics effort and thread tap QC reject rate
* New connector: Molex Pico-EZmate series
  * Improved physical robustness and resistance to shearing
  * Durable against pin damage
  * Lower profile; reduced constraint on case-side design

## 2023/01/18 - uDB C4 Release
* Announcement post - [2022-01-18: S1 and C4 Release](announcements/announcement-20230118.md)
* Successor to C3
* New connector: Molex Pico-EZmate series
  * Improved physical robustness and resistance to shearing
  * Durable against pin damage
  * Lower profile; reduced constraint on case-side design

## 2020/05/03 - uDB C3 Release
* C1 updated with protection circuitry

## 2019/05/20 - uDB C1 Release
* Initial release
