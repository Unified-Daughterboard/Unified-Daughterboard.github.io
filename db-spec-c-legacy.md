# Legacy C series (C3 and older) 


## Overview

The legacy C3 daughterboard (soon to be replaced with the C4 series) is the current most recent revision to the classic square form-factor daughterboard, with its roots in the C1 which was designed to be compatible with Wilba's keyboards.  
The daughterboard features the following:  

* ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) protection on the data lines of the USB connector through a specialized chip;
* Overcurrent protection through a PTC fuse;
* Overvoltage protection through a bidirectional TVS diode;
* Shielding noise decoupling capabilities through a ferrite bead;
* Single-path grounding of the metallic chassis to which the daughterboard is attached.
* Same form factor as C1 and C2, allowing for daughterboard upgrades

## Specification

* Overall size: 18 x 16.5 mm
* Screw holes: 14 x 12.5 mm apart.  
* Corner radius: 2 mm
* Hardware: M2 screws
* Connector: JST-SH (JST SM04B-SRSS-TB(LF)(SN))
