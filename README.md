# Unified Daughterboard

![Banner](/_media/uDB-S1-banner.jpg)

## Introduction
The Unified Daughterboard Project is an open standard to unify the USB daughterboards used in custom mechanical keyboard projects.  
The Unified Daughterboard allows designers to easily implementing electrical protection via a tested proven PCB, and allows users to maintain and repair their keyboards in the future.  
  
The Unified Daughterboard integrates USB Type C connector and the needed circuitry for USB2.0 operation in a small PCB that can be screwed into a keyboard chassis; this allows for greater case design freedom and simplifies the main circuit board.


## Features
In its latest versions, the daughterboards of this project features ESD protection, overcurrent protection, overvoltage protection, shielding noise decoupling, and single-path grounding to chassis functionality.  
Adittionally, same-letter series (C1, C2, C3, etc.) are backwards compatible, allowing for upgrading daughterboards used in past projects to newer revisions.
